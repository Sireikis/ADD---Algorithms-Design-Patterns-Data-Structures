# ADD---Algorithms-Design-Patterns-Data-Structures

I am a self taught developer using this project as a way of keeping a public journal of my studies--perhaps someone might find some of the information contained within this app useful. I will be covering Algorithms, Data Structures, and Design Patterns (primarily in Swift 5+). 

The general idea is that I'll provide a brief summary of the topic, code examples (and/or UML when appropriate), explanations, and example problems. Each of these categories may have one or more 'pages' that will present additional or alternate ways of explaining the same topic. I am not a teacher, so the presentation of these topic will probably not be very pedagogical. I envision this project to be more of a reference resource, as the exaplanation of esoteric terms may be omitted. 

Disclaimer: Since I am self-taught I cannot say that any of the examples are best practice or even correct. I will do my best to update and fix any information that is incorrect. If you would like to inform me of the error of my ways, feel free to contact me at iscode@yahoo.com.
