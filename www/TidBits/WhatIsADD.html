        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        ADD (my acronym for Algorithms, Design patterns, and Data structures) is designed to be a reference app for fundamental concepts in computer science. As I learn new concepts, or alternate explanations of previously covered topics, I will add that content.

        <p>
        I cannot be certain that all information presented in this app will be correct or remain correct in the future. This app does not focus on teaching topics, esoteric terms are often used without previous explanation. I will do my best to update and fix any information that is incorrect. If you would like to inform me of the error of my ways, feel free to contact me at iscode@yahoo.com.
