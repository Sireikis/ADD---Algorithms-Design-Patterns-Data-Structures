        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        ADD (my acronym for Algorithms, Design patterns, and Data structures) is designed to be a reference app for fundamental concepts in computer science. As I learn new concepts, or alternate explanations of previously covered topics, I will add that content. Currently code is written in Swift, with minimal language specific details. If more languages are added, language specific details may be introduced. I plan to add "Explanation" and "Example" sections for each topic to provide a more in-depth look than the cursory glances the "Summary" and "Code" sections provide.
        </p>

        I cannot be certain that all information presented in this app will be correct or remain correct in the future. Current code examples may not be the most optimized versions, but rather general outlines for the framework of the topic. This app does not focus on teaching topics, esoteric terms are often used without previous explanation. I will do my best to update and fix any information that is incorrect. If you would like to inform me of the error of my ways, feel free to contact me at iscode@yahoo.com.
