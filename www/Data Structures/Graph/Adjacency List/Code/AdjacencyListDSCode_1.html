            // Adjacency List - Basic Structure
            // Method: Dictionary of Arrays

            /*
             This implementation will use a dictionary to store every
             vertex as a key and all its associated edges as an array
             of values. The array of values represent a list of all
             vertices that the current vertex (the key) is adjacent
             to--hence the name. Depending on the type of graph,
             vertices can point to each other to form a cycle or
             even point to themselves.
             
             Using the implementation below, we can make a directed
             or undirected graph. We will choose to make an undirected
             graph, where each vertex is an airport and each edge is
             weighted, representing the cost of travel. Traveling
             between any two vertices in either direction costs the
             same--the weight of the edge. Given the context, no
             vertices (airports) will point to themselves.

             Since we are using a dictionary, answering this
             question involves searching for a value, which in
             the worst case is done in O(n) time. On average

             The variables V (the number of vertices) and n
             (the number of key-value pairs) are equivalent.
             Hence, the time complexity for a Hash Table search
             O(n) and an Adjacency List Query O(V) are
             equivalent--assuming implementation uses the
             dictionary of arrays method.

             In order to delete a vertex we need to iterate

             to each other, we need to remove the references
             that each vertex has to the given vertex. The key
             for that vertex should also be removed.
             
             When we iterate over the dictionary we visit every
             vertex (key) and each value for that key (edges).
             Hence, the time complexity for removing a vertex is
             O(V + E).
