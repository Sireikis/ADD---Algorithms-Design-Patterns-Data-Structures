        The Big O below is in the context of an Adjacency List utilizing a dictionary of arrays method and Depth First Search. The letter "V" refers to the number of <b>vertices</b> and "E" to the number of <b>edges</b>.

        <sup>*</sup>Query is defined as: Given a vertex, what are its edges? In our implementation this boils down to searching the adjacency dictionary for a value, where V also represents the number of key-value pairs. In this case a key-value pair is a vertex and all its edges. Since we're using a dictionary, access technically doesn't exist--it's a Hash Table. Conceptually, we're going to conflate access and search. Hence, practically we can expect &Theta;(1) 'access' times, but technically the worst case is still O(V).

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        An Adjacency List represents a graph as some collection that associates a vertex with all of its neighboring vertices--its edges. There are several methods for accomplishing this:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Dictionary of Arrays:</b> Each key represents a vertex and the associated value is an array of edges.</li>
            <li><b>Array of Arrays:</b> A given index of the outer array represents a vertex. The array at a given index contains edges for that vertex.</li>
            <li><b>Array of Linked-Lists:</b> A given index of the outer array represents a vertex, which stores a linked-list containing edges for that vertex.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        The relationship between vertices and their edges can be classified as directed or undirected. Directed edges communicate a notion of direction, with or without a cost associated with traveling in that direction--a weight. Undirected edges can be thought of as an association, either indicating no direction or a two-way relationship. In other words, they represent whether or not a relationship exists between two vertices. They can be implemented as two directed edges or as pairs of vertices.
