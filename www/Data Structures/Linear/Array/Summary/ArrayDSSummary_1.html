        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Arrays are contiguous data structures that allow constant time access and linear time for other operations. The structural properties of arrays lend themselves to storing data that care about order, as we can easily navigate through an array in a predictable manner.
        </p>

        <p>
        All data in an array must be of the same type, which is declared when the array is created. In low-level languages arrays are created with a predefined amount of space, called the capacity. When an array is created the amount of space that is actually reserved corresponds to the type of data it has declared it'll hold. When the capacity of an array is exceeded, reallocation is triggered. Reallocation is the process of copying items from one array into a new array. Typically the size of the new array is twice that of the original.
