        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Binary Trees consist of segments called Nodes, which may contain some value and point towards up to two other nodes--these nodes are called children. A Binary Tree limits the number of children for each Node to two, a left and right child. There are many different types of binary trees that impose an invariant or try to 'balance' the tree.
