        <h1 class="title">Design Pattern Categories</h1>
        
        <p>
        The categories listed here classify patterns by their purpose. It's important to note that the following categories are not exhaustive, and that many patterns exist that differ by their scope. For example, low-level language specific patterns exist (called idioms), as well as high-level architectural patterns.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Behavioral</h2>
        <p>
        Behavioral Patterns focus on handling communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects. Through object composition, conformance to interfaces, and the application of object-orientated principles, various behaviors between objects are achieved. Some examples are publisher-subscriber systems, encapsulation of requests (to implement undo and redo for example), and interchangeable algorithms to modify behavior at runtime.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Creational</h2>
        <p>
        Creational Patterns provide various ways of creating objects, often encapsulating object creation so that it may be performed at runtime. Coupling object creation to objects that depend on them makes for an inflexible system that cannot be changed at runtime. These patterns often solve this coupling problem.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Structural</h2>
        <p>
        Structural Patterns help assemble objects into larger structures that are more flexible. Often this is achieved through object composition. Some problems solved by these patterns are: incompatible interfaces, simplifying use of complicated interrelated interfaces, and controlling access to objects.
