        <p>
        Observer Pattern allows you to create a one-to-many relationship between an object that changes, the Publisher, and objects that want to know when the publisher changes, the Subscribers. Whenever the state of the publisher changes, all subscribers are notified. There are two variants of this pattern. In the Push variant, the publisher pushes all information that can change to all subscribers. In the Pull variant, the publisher notifies all subscribers that its state has changed, then individual subscribers pull the information they want from the publisher using its interface.
