        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Strategy Pattern allows clients to vary their behavior by defining a family of algorithms and encapsulating each one, making them interchangeable. The algorithm will vary independently from the clients that use it and can be modified at runtime. By coding to an interface we replace inheritance with composition.

        Note that many languages have support for anonymous functions, which may be preferred depending on the situation.
