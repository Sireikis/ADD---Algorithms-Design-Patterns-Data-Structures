        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Proxy Pattern creates a substitute for another object, typically to control access to it. By making the object in question (the realSubject) and the Proxy both conform to the same interface (Subject), our client won't know the difference between the two. When the client makes a request to the realSubject, we can use a Proxy to do something before or after the request is made--or control if it's made at all. Besides access control, we can use Proxy pattern for lazy initialization, caching, logging, etc.
