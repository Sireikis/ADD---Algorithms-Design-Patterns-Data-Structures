        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to interact. This is achieved by altering the interface that an object uses to access another object. The Adapter is placed in between these two objects, allowing one object to call methods from the other object using an interface that the Adapter provides. The adapter will call the appropriate methods from the Adaptee to pass along to the Client.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This can be useful in cases where the Adaptee cannot be changed, such as in legacy code. If we wanted to, we could add logic to the Adapter to modify the return results of the Adaptee, perhaps to a format that is more acceptable.
