        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Abstract Factory Pattern provides a way of creating multiple related or interdependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Clients hold an instance of the factory they want to use, which can be easily changes at runtime of need be. The factory determines which batch of products to create. Factory methods are coded to Product interfaces to decouple concrete classes from each other.
