        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Merge Sort is given an array, which must contain at least two elements, otherwise it is considered sorted and returned. The index of the middle element is determined by dividing the length of the array by two--rounding up or down doesn't matter. The previous steps are recursively repeated by handing merge sort all elements to the left of the middle element. In other words merge sort is given the subsection from index 0 up to but not including the middle index. The previous steps are recursively repeated by handing merge sort all elements to the right of the middle element. In other words merge sort is given the subsection from the middle index up to the last index. Lastly, the merge function is called with the left and right arrays.

        <p>
        By the time the merge function is reached, the array has been split into individual arrays of size 1, which are considered sorted. The job of the merge function is to merge these singular arrays and all subsequent arrays until the array is recombined in sorted order. It's important to note that both the left and right arrays are sorted as they both grow in subsequent merges. In an ascending order sort, we iterate over the left and right arrays, placing every element in the left array that's smaller than the first element in the right array into a new array. By the end of this process the left or right array may still contain elements, in which case we iterate over the left and then the right array individually, adding the remaining elements to the new array. The new array is return sorted, ready to be the left or right array of the next merge function call--or is returned as the final sorted array.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As long as all elements in the left array are processed first, merge sort is stable.
