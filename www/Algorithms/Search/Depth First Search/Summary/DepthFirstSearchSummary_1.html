        Depth First Search is applied to graph data structures, so here "V" refers to the number of <b>vertices</b> and "E" to the number of <b>edges</b>. A vertex is also called a node.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Depth First Search can be used on graphs, hence it utilizes a queue structure to avoid cycling. A given node is appended to a queue structure, perhaps an array. The node is marked as visited using an associative array (like a dictionary), where the node can be the key and a boolean the value. Then a series of steps are repeated until the queue is empty.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A node is dequeued, if it matches the target the node is returned and the search ends. If it does not, in order to get depth first traversal behavior, we recursively call a function that does the following: For every child of that node, we check if that child has been added to the visited dictionary. If it hasn't, we enqueue it and add it to the visited dictionary. We recursively call the function again, which is repeated until all nodes are visited.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        At this point only the root (given node) has been checked against the target. All remaining nodes are now in the queue, ordered by a traversal that navigates as far left and down as it can. Nodes are dequeued and checked against the target until search completes.
